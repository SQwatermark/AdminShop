AdminShop

This mod allows modpack developers or server owners to define their own in-game shop for players to interact with via config file.
Players can buy from and sell to the shop for an in-game currency.

Blocks:

Shop: This is how players can interact with the shop. Right clicking this will open the shop GUI.

ATM: This allows players to withdraw money in the form of a check. Right clicking the check will deposit the money stored on it into the account of whoever right clicked it.

Seller: This block, registered to whoever places it down, will automatically sell all valid items, fluids, and power to the adminshop and insert the profits into the owner's account. Items can be piped in (through a hopper for example).

Create better models for blocks
Commands

Finished:

Switched accounts to reference player UUID instead of username
